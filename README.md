## Why i used an own Repository for this here?

Ill personally plan to using AzuraCast in an modified way. (Need this great AutoDJ only)

I need an fast way to react on changes, to make modifications and the most important reason is security. I know what i done here. When i using the Repository on ohter sides, it will make me work to check what was changed. I hate work that was not planned, so please understand that i only can ensure this in this way. But it is easy to add this to the default repro. Im personally not feeling, that this is something that the developers wanted outside theire docker business.

## How to install?

Just on line for you
